# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

Ans:

1. Scan infrastructure as code templates
    - Use Terra-scan: Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure
     
~ Example vulnerability:
- Use of Non-SSL/TLS 
- Use of Resource prioritization
- Use of proper configuration
- Use of proper permission( least privilege)


2. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
     - Use Clair scanner, AquaSec or Qualys Virtual Scanner

~ Example vulnerability:
 - CVE vulnerabilities 

3. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
     	- AWS super SecurityHub is the right tool for the job	
	- AWS Inspector for automated vulnerability management
- 

~ Example vulnerability
     - Password policies compliance
     - S3 buckets policy with public write or read permissions
