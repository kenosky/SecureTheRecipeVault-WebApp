# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Ans:

+-------------+
1. By all means it is not a good practice to allow ssh from public internet to your ec2 instances. So do not allow it
2. Also, very important to prevent root account login over SSH - bad idea
3. Always Configure complex password if you must use one. - at least more than 8 characters, and use of specific characters, and avoid password reuse 

PS - Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in case of API compromise we can prevent unwanted access to the data.

- We can restrict the security policy of the instances to only have access to the free recipes bucket, if need be :)
