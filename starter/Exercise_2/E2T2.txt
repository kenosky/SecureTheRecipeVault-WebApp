Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
*******************
Ans:


1.) IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, by it allowing full access to resources such as s3
2.) EC2 instance should be managed by AWS Systems Manager if possible
3.) Application running on port 5000 can be easily accessible directly from public internet - this can be change to a more secure port
4.) Serverside encryption and Logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5.) Loadbalancer is not configured to redirect Non-SSL(HTTP) requests to SSL(HTTPS)



** Bonus ** - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
*******************
*******************
# Enable MFA for root access.
# Traffic should only be allowed from security groups.
# Make sure to set IAM policy to readonly or specific role.
# Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
# Limit traffic on the Loadbalancer
# Enable logging for S3 buckets.
# Have a stricter IAM password policy.
